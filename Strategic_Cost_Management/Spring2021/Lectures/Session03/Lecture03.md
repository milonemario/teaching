Direct Labor

* Works fine in old traditional manufacturing
  * Where labor was the major cost
* Black Box that leads to distortions
  * Allocation will not reflect a cause\-effect relationship between OH and product manufacturing
* As more automation is introduced\, more indirect costs accumulate
  * Need for more accurate system

# Two-Stage Allocation Systems

* Stage one
  * Allocate overhead costs to departments
* Stage two
  * Allocate department overhead costs to the products \(or services\)

# Activity-Based Costing

* Costing method that
  * First\, assigns costs to __activities__
  * Then\, allocate them to products based on their __consumption__ of activities
* Stage one
  * Assign costs to activities
* Stage two
  * Allocate costs to products

# Why Activity-Based Costing?

* Instead of having a top\-down approach to determine cost pools\, ABCis morebottom\-up\, starting from the activities\.
* The idea is that
  * Products consume activities
  * Activities consume resources

# When to use ABC?

* Significant indirect costs in proportion to direct costs
* Complex products
  * Many inputs and processes
* Heterogeneous products
  * High\-volume standard products as well as low\-volume complex  products
* Clues to move to ABC
  * Low\-volume products are profitable while high\-volume ones are not
  * Market prices seem at odd with costs
  * Operations have changed but not the costing system
  * Higher sales but decline in overall income

# ABC - Steps

* Identify the __activities__ that consume the resources
  * And determine the cost for each activities
* Identify the __cost drivers__ associated with each activity
  * And determine their consumptions for each activity
  * Note: Drivers __cause__ activities
* Compute the cost driver __rate__ for each activity
* Allocate costs based on products' __use__ of activities

# Activities and Cost Drivers - Examples

# Cost Hierarchy

# ABC VS Traditional Systems

# Example

* So far\, a traditional costing system is used:
  * __Manufacturing OH__ costs allocated based on __DL hours__
  * __Customer service__ costs allocated based on __revenue__

Markup of 50% on the products

* Sales of product A have __increased__ steadily but company income has __declined__
  * Management is unhappy with the traditional costing system
  * They have decided to try activity\-based costing
* Additionally\, management has observed that
  * The cost of labor is relatively stable
  * Therefore\, it does not behave like a unit\-driver cost
  * Labor will be combined with OH and the total _conversion cost_ will be assigned using ABC

The following activities and costs have been identified

We now need to determine the drivers \.\.\.

\.\.\. and compute the cost driver rates

So we can finally compute the product costs

For __Product A__ \, we have

So we can finally compute the product costs

For __Product B__ \, we have

* Let's compute the __product costs__ using ABC
* ABC usually results in a shift of OH from high\-volume standard products to low\-volume more complex products
  * Very common result\. Many companies have found that low\-volume specialized products have greater OH costs than previously realized

* Based on these results\, the management decides to also use ABC to assign its $500\,000 __customer service costs__
  * __Activity__ : Customer consultations
  * __Driver__ : Number of customer consultations per unit sold
* Let's now compare the costs between traditional costing and ABC

Remember\, under __Traditional Costing__ \, we had

Under __ABC__ \, we now have

* What should the management decide?
* Maybe increase the price of product A
* Maybe the price of product B is too high
  * Reducing its price may increase profits through higher demand

# Pros and Cons of ABC

* Pros
  * Better measurements of the activities driving the costs
  * More accurate and informative
  * Leads to better decisions
* Cons
  * Very expensive to develop\, implement\, and maintain
  * As well as very time\-consuming

# Takeaways

Traditional method focuses on labor

ABC focuses on __activities__

__Causality__ is crucial

Useful when activities are __heterogeneous__

Popular in financial and health care industry

# Time Driven ABC

# Time Driven ABC (TDABC)

* TDABC are ABC systems that use time to
  * Calculate the cost of a resource
  * Allocate the costs to cost objects

# Boston Children's Hospital (BCH)

* Market leader among pediatric hospitals
* Handles complex and rare cases in expensive facilities
  * Expensive equipment and personal
* But also treats normal range of children's ailments and injuries

# BCH challenges

* Competitive pressure driving business away from high cost BCH
* Pressure from payers \(government\, insurers \.\.\.\)
* Want to attract more patients with complex conditions
* Existing cost system seems broken
  * Average across complex and simple cases
  * Opportunity for process improvements

# BCH current cost system: RCC

* RCC: Ratio of Cost to Charges
* Assumes that costs are proportional to charges
  * Divide costs by charges to get RCC rate

Physicians practices' charges

Dept\. Traceable Expenses

Hospital shared costs

Total Costs

$4\.2M

Total Charges

$7\.0M

Cost = Charge \* RCC rate

# Dept. of Plastic and Oral Surgery (DPOS)

* Focus on 3 conditions encountered at BCH's DPOS
* __Plagiocephaly__
  * Common disorder characterized by flattening of the head or face
* __Neoplasm__
  * Harmless cutaneous growths that includes common skin lesions
* __Craniosynostosis__
  * Deformity that arose when sutures \(connections separating an infant's skill bones\) fused earlier than normal
  * Far more serious condition than Plagiocephaly

# RCC at DPOS

# BCH facts

* Dr Meara\, Chief of the DPOS  examined the costs of providing care to patients with cleft palates and several other conditions treated in the department
* He learned that 40% of the costs of the 18 months of care for certain patients were incurred during the few days they sent in the ICU after surgery
* He decided to start a pilot and apply TDABC to the DPOS to measure costs more accurately

# TDABC Approach - Data Requirements

* Gather detailed costs of resources
* Map out every administrative and clinical process involved in the treatments
* Estimate the time each treatment uses for each resource
* Focus on the initial clinical visit to complete the costing quickly
  * and compare TDABC with RCC cost estimates

# Time-Drive Costs in DOPS

RCC shifts costs from Neoplasm and Craniosynostosis to Plagiocephaly

# Suggested Course of Action

* May have to lower prices on Plagiocephaly to meet competition
* May need to raise prices for Craniosynostosis
  * Especially if wants to build national ad international practice for this condition
* Eliminate process steps that do not contribute to improved patient outcomes
* Redesign the processes to reduce wast and idle time
* Optimize processes over complete cycle of care
