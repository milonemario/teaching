# Outline

Budgeting

Variance Analysis for Costs

Variance Analysis for Revenues

Variance regarding Fixed Overheads

# Budgeting

Static Budget

Flexible Budget

Actual Budget

# Static Budget

* Ex\-ante analysis of what management expects to happen in the future
  * Sales projection
  * Operating and financial budgets
  * Pro\-forma financial statement
* Is done __before__ any realization of sales volume

# Flexible Budget

Is done __after__ the realization of sales volume

Adjusts for changes in volume __only\!__

Applies __estimates__ of variable costs\(from static budget\)to new volume level

Fixed costs __do not change__ \(within a relevant range\)

Often prepared for purpose of __performance evaluation__

# Example

What is the static budget?

* The company actually sold 3\,000 units
  * What is the flexible budget?

How did the firm perform?

We have to look at the __Actual Budget__ \.

How did the firm perform?

We can now look into the Variance Analysis\.

# Variance Analysis

Variance Analysis for Costs

Variance Analysis for Revenues

Variance regarding fixed OH

* What are we trying to do?
  * We want to understand why the actual budget is different that the static one \(the one we budgeted at the beginning of the period\)
* Where could the difference come from?
  * We could have sold more or less products \(error in the budgeted sales volume\)
  * Or we could have been more or less efficient \(use of resources\, price of buying materials\, selling price\)

* Variance analysis is trying to decompose where thechangescome from\.
* Our Static\, Flexible and Actual budgets are going to help\, but how?
  * Flexible budget is capturing what changed because of a change in sales volumes
  * Actual budget is what really happened
* Great\! We should have all we need to understand all the changes\.

# Variance Analysis for Costs

* Let us first focus on Costs and understand both the changes in Volume and the changes inEfficiency separately:
* Volume Variance
  * Market Share Variance
  * Market Volume Variance
* Flexible Budget Variance
  * Price Variance
  * Efficiency Variance

Total Cost Variance

Flexible Budget Variance

Actual \- Flexible

Flexible \- Static

Efficiency Variance

Market Share Variance

Market Volume Variance

# Volume Variance

* Difference between the flexible and the static budget
  * Why? The flexible budget specifically consider the change in Volume\.
* __Volume Variance = \(SU\-AU\)\*SP\*SI__
* We will use the following notations
  * SP: Standard Price of the resource
  * SI: Standard Input of resource / unit
  * SU: Standard number of units
  * AP: Actual Price of the resource
  * AI: Actual Input of resource / unit
  * AU: Actual number of units

# Efficiency Variance

* Measures the impact of using more or less inputs
  * We use the __standard price__ of the resource and only focus oninputs
* __Efficiency Variance = \(SI\-AI\)\*SP\*AU__
* We use the actual number of units produced \(AU\) to understand how the change of resources usage impacted our actual cost\.

# Price Variance for Cost Inputs

Measures the effect coming from a change in input price\.

__Price Variance = \(SP\-AP\)\*AI\*AU__

We use the actual input used \(AI\) to understand how the changes in input prices impacted our actual cost\.

# Standard Cost Production Variance

Total Cost Variance

Efficiency Variance

# Example: Pencil Company

Assume Production = Sales and all purchases are used in production

Compute the Static Budget\, Flexible Budget\, Volume Variance and Flexible Budget Variance for Wood\. Could do the same for VOH \(labor\)\.

Then compute the Efficiency Variance and Price Variance

# Favorable and Unfavorable Variances

* <span style="color:#00B050">Favorable</span> variance would <span style="color:#00B050">increase</span> operating profits \(all else constant\)
* <span style="color:#FF0000">Unfavorable</span> variance would <span style="color:#FF0000">decrease</span> operating profits \(all else constant\)
  * Sometimes called _Adverse Variance_ \(UK\)
* For Volume Variance
  * Unfavorable if actual production > budgeted production \(increases __costs__ \, not lookingat revenues yet\)
* For Efficiency Variance
  * Unfavorable if actual input > budgeted input \(per unit produced\)
* For Price \(spending\) Variance
  * Unfavorable if actual input price > budgeted input price

# Variance Analysis for Revenues

* We now look at revenues / profits\.
* We consider __selling prices instead of inputs prices__  __\.__
* Volume Variance
  * Market Share Variance
  * Market Volume Variance
* Price Variance
  * Pure Price Variance
  * Product Mix Variance

Total Revenue Variance

Pure Price Variance

Product Mix Variance

Market Share Variance

Market Volume Variance

<span style="color:#C00000">Products sold</span>

<span style="color:#C00000">for \+/\-</span>

<span style="color:#C00000">Sold \+/\- of high</span>

<span style="color:#C00000">price products</span>

* How much did the change in Volume impact our revenues?
* __Volume Variance = \(AU\-SU\)\*BP__
* We add the following notations
  * BP: __Average__ Budgeted Price \(per unit sold\)
  * AP: __Average__ Actual Price \(per unit sold\)
  * BAP: __Average__ Budgeted Price at Actual Mix \(see below\)

# Price Variance

* How much did the changes in selling prices impact our revenues
* __Total Price Variance = AU\*\(AP\-BP\)__
* It can be __separated__ between:
  * Pure Price Variance
  * Product Mix Variance

# Pure Price Variance

* Pure Price Variance consider only the impact in products prices\, but not the effect of selling more or less of higher price products \(product mix\)
* We need to __keep the product mix constant__ \, and use only the actual product mix
* __Pure Price Variance = AU\*\(AP\-BAP\)__
  * BAP: Average Budgeted Price at the Actual Mix
  * AP: Actual Price

# Product Mix Variance

* Product Mix Variance only consider the impact of the change in product mix on revenues
* instead of fixing the product mix\, __we fix the budgeted prices__
* __Mix Variance = AU\*\(BAP\-BP\)__
  * BAP: Average Budgeted Price at the Actual Mix
  * BP: Average Budgeted Price

# Example: Furniture Company

We need to compute the average prices to aggregate the information\.

Average Budgeted Price at Actual Mix = Average price if sold what we actually sold at the budgeted prices\.

Note: Volume Variance is not exactly the same as the difference between Static and Flexible Budget when there is a product mix

$80\,000 includes the changes coming from the volume as well as the change in product mix\.

# Variance Regarding Fixed OH

* When talking about FOH\, Flexible and Static budgets are the same \(as fixed costs do not depend on volume within the relevant range\)
* Spending Variance in FOH
  * Did we incur more or less FOH overall?
* Production Volume Variance
  * Did we have more or less FOH per unit because of difference in production?

# Spending Variance

Did we incur more or less FOH overall?

__Spending Variance = Budgeted FOH \- Actual FOH__

Unfavorable if incur more FOH than budgeted

# Production Volume Variance

Did we have more or less FOH per unit because of difference in production?

Production Volume Variance = Applied FOH \- Budgeted FOH

Applied FOH is the FOH allocated using __Actual Units__ produced and __Budgeted rates__

Unfavorable if Actual Production < Budgeted Production

# Variance Regarding Fixed OH

Production Volume Variance

Spending Variance in FOH

Here\, SP is the FOH rate

# Example: Philadelphia Company

Compute the overhead variances

Let's look at the FOH

Total actual FOH is lower: Favorable Spending Variance

Production is lower: Unfavorable Production Volume Variance \(excess capacity\)

* How about the VOH?
  * Remember what we just saw before \(variance analysis for costs\)

AI = 39\,000 / 9\,500
