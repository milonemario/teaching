### Managerial accounting aims to

Study internal information in order to

- Encourage better decision-making.
- Influence the behavior of those making the decision.


### What types of decisions?
::: incremental
- What to produce?
- How much to produce / sell?
- What price should be charged?
- What input to use?
:::

. . .

Need data from the internal accounting system to make those decisions.

### Main objective of the course

How do we measure the creation of value?

. . .

Cost and profitability measurements.

. . .

__Goal: decision making and incentives.__

Managerial Accounting: Making Decisions and Motivating Performance

by S. Datar and M. Rajan. Pearson, 2014, ISBN 978-0-13-702487-2


- Online classes on Zoom: Link on Canvas homepage,
- Canvas website: Communication, classes recording, submissions, etc.
- Each class consists of 2 parts:
    - Part I: Lecture on key concepts.
    - Part II: Case Study.


### Why case studies?
- Study real problems in real context.
- Stimulate critical thinking.
- Requires student involvement and expression of different points of view.
- Your job:
    - Create groups that will be fixed for the entire course.
    - Every week, read the case study for the class.
    - Prepare the questions (check Canvas) and submit your answers (on Canvas) per group.


### Evaluation
- Every group case study assignment will be graded.
- The final will be a (guided) case study to be done at home individually!
- You are required to respect academic integrity.
- The final grade consists of
    - 50% from the group case studies assignments
    - 50% from the final case individual case study
- Grading may slightly change between now and the end of the quarter, but only in your interest.

## Cost Concepts

### Cost Concepts - Overview

- Cost vs Expense
- Direct vs Indirect Costs
- Fixed vs Variable Costs
- Sunk vs Incremental Costs
- Opportunity Cost

### [Cost]{.col1} vs [Expense]{.col2}

::: columns
:::: column
:::: col2
Expenses

> - Follow the accounting matching principle.
> - Are reported on the income statement in the same period of the related revenues.
> - Don’t necessarily involve a cash outflow.

::::
::::
:::: column
:::: col1
Cost

::: incremental
- Sacrifice of resources, cash out-flow
    - Example: manufacturing costs
- Costs become expenses when the goods are sold.

### [Direct]{.col1} vs [Indirect]{.col2} Costs
::: columns

:::: col1
Direct Costs

Indirect Costs

> - Cannot be traced directly.
> - Also referred to as overhead costs.
> - Need to be allocated according to some formula.

### [Fixed]{.col1} vs [Variable]{.col2} Costs
::: columns
:::: column
:::: col1
Fixed Costs

> - Do not vary with production volume
> - Example: Depreciation of buildings

::::

:::: column
:::: col2
Variable Costs

> - Proportional to production volume
> - Merchandise, product parts
> - Relevant range
> - In the long term everything is variable

### Product Costing (in a manufacturing firm)

::: columns
:::: column
MANUFACTURING

- Direct
    - Direct Material
    - Direct Labor
- Indirect
    - Variable
    - Fixed

Most are charged to the product.

Sometimes, fixed OH is not charged.

::::
:::: column
NON-MANUFACTURING

- SG&A
- Advertising
- Marketing
- Administrative
- Selling

Not charged to the product

### [Sunk]{.col1} vs [Incremental]{.col2} Costs
Sunk and Incremental costs are *relative to a decision*.

::: columns
:::: column
:::: col1
Sunk Costs

> - Cannot be altered by the decision.
> - R&D, advertising, staff training, consultants.

::::
::::
:::: column
:::: col2
Incremental Costs

> - Additional cost incurred by the decision.
> - Also referred to as **Differential Costs**.

::::

:::

> - What type of cost should affect the decision?
> - __Only incremental costs!__

### Opportunity Cost
Opportunity cost: what is forgone by choosing an alternative

Very important concept for decision making!

### Opportunity Cost

You won a free ticket to see an Eric Clapton concert (which has no resale value).

Bob Dylan is performing on the same night and is your next-best alternative activity.

Tickets to see Dylan cost \\$40 and you would be willing to pay \\$50 for it on any given day.

. . .

What is the opportunity cost of seeing Eric Clapton?

a) $0
b) $10
c) $40
d) $50

### Opportunity Cost
Answer: $10

::: incremental
- By not going to see Dylan, you decide to forgo utility equivalent to \\$50 - \\$40 = $10.
- At the 2005 annual meeting of the AEA, researchers Paul J. Ferraro and Laura O. Taylor of Georgia
State University asked almost 200 professional economists to answer the same question.
    - Only 21.6% got the right answer.
- They originally asked the same question to a large group of college students.
    - Among those who had taken a course in economics, 7.4% answered correctly.
    - 17.2% answered correctly for those who had never taken one.

## Example <br/> USPS and Amazon

### Example: USPS and Amazon

> Amazon is costing the United States Post Office massive
> amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy. Amazon should
> pay these costs (plus) and not have them borne by the American
> Taxpayer. Many billions of dollars. Only fools, or worse, are
> saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with
> Amazon. THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed. Also,
> our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the
> country...not a level playing field!

### USPS Customers in 2017
::: incremental
- Retail Customers
    - Based on demand elasticity and marginal cost data, the U.S Post Office has
    decided to charge retail customers __$4.00__ per package.

- Fedex
    - In 2016, USPS negotiated a contract with Fedex for five years, under which Fedex pays the
    Postal Office __$2.20__ per package delivered.

- Amazon
    - In 2017, the Postal Office negotiated a service agreement with Amazon. Under the
    terms of this agreement, USPS delivers 400 million packages for Amazon, at a price of __$1.05__ per
    package.

### USPS Variable Cost
```table

markdown: True
csv-kwargs:

                ;Variable Cost ($ per unit)

Delivery        ;$ 0.25
Collection      ;$ 0.25
__Total__       ;__$ 1__
```

- USPS estimates that 50% of its overhead cost is fixed
    - Arising from the need to maintain USPS’ infrastructure:
    300,000 routes, 200 millions delivery points, 50,000 post offices.
- How many packages did USPS deliver in 2017?

### Is USPS making money on Amazon?
- Need to answer the following:
    - What would be the revenues for USPS with and without the Amazon deal?
    - In other words, what are the incremental revenue and incremental cost of the Amazon deal?
- Assumptions:
    - USPS charges Fedex a price per package equals to average cost plus 10% margin
    where average cost is defined as

$$ \text{Average Cost} = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{\text{Volume}} $$

Without the Amazon deal, Fedex volume would be 270 millions instead of 300. (we’ll see why)

### With the Amazon deal
- How much does Fedex pay per package? __$2.2__
- Remember that
    - Total Volume = 1000 (retail) + 300 (Fedex) + 400 (Amazon) = 1700
    - Total Cost = 1700 (fixed) + 1700 * \\$1 (variable) = $3400

$$ \text{Average Cost} = \frac{\$3400}{1700} = \$2 $$

Fedex price = $2 * (1+10%) = __$2.2__

### Without the Amazon deal
- How much does Fedex pay per package?
$2.57
- Without the deal, we have
- Total Volume = 1000 (retail) + 270 (Fedex) = 1270
- Total Cost = 1700 (fixed) + 1270 * \\$1 (variable) = $2970

$$ \text{Average Cost} = \frac{\$2970}{1270} = \$2.33 $$

Fedex price = $2.33 * (1+10%) = __$2.57__

### From USPS side
- Even if the variable cost is $1, the incremental cost of serving Amazon now incudes an
opportunity cost through the change in Fedex pricing.
    - Variable cost of Amazon packages = 400*\\$1 = \\$400.
    - Forgone revenues on Fedex deal = 270\*(2.57-1) – 300*(2.2-1) = 424 – 360 = $64
- Incremental Cost Amazon Deal = $464
- Incremental Revenue Amazon deal = $420 (400*1.05)

### From USPS side
With Amazon deal (exclude retail)

- Revenues = Fedex + Amazon = 300\*(2.2-1) + 400*(1.05-1) = 360 + 20 = $380

Without Amazon deal

- Revenues = Fedex = 270*(2.57-1) = $424

### Break-even price of Amazon deal?
What price should USPS charge Amazon to see no change in revenues?

- Price p should solves the following equation:

$$300*2.2 − 1 + 400*p − 1 = 270*(2.57 − 1)$$

For USPS to breakeven on its Amazon deal, Amazon must pay __$1.16__ per package.

### Takeaway
For decision making, focus on __incremental costs__.

- Include variable costs
- Exclude fixed costs
- Add relevant opportunity cost (e.g. forgone revenues)
