# Outline

* Join product costing
* Strategic Competition
  * The case of Ryanair initial launch strategy
* Strategy and Balanced Scorecard: Introduction

# Joint Product Costing

* Remember Death Spiral when cutting product lines
  * Increase in OH
  * leading to increase in cost
  * leading to cutting more product lines
* Somesimilarity and differenceswhen considering __Joint Costs__

# Joint Costs

__Join Cost__ : Cost incurred to produce two or more outputs from the same input

Consider a firm that produces __fillets__ \, __drumstick__ and __wings__ from chickens\.

The chicken and the initial processing part costs $2\.00

# Joint Costs: Split-Off point

__Split\-off point__ : The point beyond which further processing has to take place for fillets\, drumsticks and wings before they can be sold

Let us consider the following data

# Joint Costs Decisions

Should a product be sold at the split\-off point or processed further?

Is the joint cost incurred up to the split\-off point relevant in deciding whether to process further?

How to allocate joint costs to products?

# Joint Costs: How to Allocate?

We need to allocate the joint costsof $2\.00

By __weight__ seems appropriate \(Weight in oz\)

# Net Profits with Join Cost Allocation

With weight\-based allocation

If input/output prices are fixed\, it appears optimal to __drop__  __the__  __wings__

# Joint Costs: How to Allocate:

Let's drop the wings

Redistribute the costs by weight again across fillets and drumsticks

# Joint Cost Allocation: Death Spiral

Net Profits with weight\-based allocation

Now\, it seems optimal to __drop the drumsticks__

Let’s drop the drumsticks

Net Profits with weight\-based allocation

And then now we should __drop__  __the__  __fillets__ \!

# Joint Costs & Net Realizable Value

Let us change the way we allocate the joint costs

We now allocate the costs by proportion of NRV

Joint Costs shift from Drumsticks and Wings towards Fillets

Profits with __NRV__ \-based allocation

* Proportion of Net Realizable Value \(NRV\) is the only correct way to allocate joint costs
* Why?
  * Once the joint costs are incurred\, the company is going to have fillets\, drumstick and wings anyway
  * As long as the profit margins on each of those products are positive\, the joint costs are essentially __irrelevant__ in deciding the relative profitability of product lines

# Takeaways

* Death Spirals result not just from overhead allocation but also from __cost\-of\-raw material__ allocations as well
* In most or at least many cases\, there are credible alternate allocation methods to avoid death spirals
  * e\.g\.JointCosts should be allocated using __Net Realizable Values__ \.

* Joint Product Costs incurred prior to the split\-off point are __sunk costs__
  * Not affected by a decision to process further after the split\-off point
* A product should be processed beyond the split\-off point only if the __incremental revenue__ exceeds the __incremental processing costs__

# Strategic Competitionand Profitability

# Profitability and Strategy

* Profitability and Strategy are tightly intertwined
* We cannot assess profitability correctly without an understanding of the competition and strategic interaction
* Let’s have a look at Ryanair Initial Launch Strategy
  * Combines elements of pricing\, competition and profitability\.

# The case of Ryanair

Since 1985\, Ryanair had operated a 4\-seat turboprop between Waterfront \(Ireland\) and Gatwick Airport \(London\)

In 1986\, Ryanair announced that it would soon commence service between Dublin and London \(Luton\)

For the first time\, Ryanair is going to face Aer Lingus \(AL\) and British Airways \(BA\) on a major route

# Ryanair

* The Dublin\-London route was reputed to be quite lucrative
  * Only route for Aer Lingus that has a reasonable return on capital
* Current least expensive fares on those routes from Aer Lingus and BA
  * I£208\(UK£189\)
  * Discount fares as low asI£99 if booked one month in advance
* Ryanair entended to run 4 roundtrips per day with  44\-seat turboprop
  * Differentiation strategy: deliver first\-rate customer service
  * Simple single fare ofI£98 with no restrictions

* Our Focus
  * Assess Ryanair's initial launch Strategy
  * Can Ryanar make money at a fare of 98?
* Two important facts
  * US airlines seem to be more efficient than European airlines \(in terms of costs and staff per passenger\)
  * Ryanair estimates that Aer Lingus and BA have utilization rates of 60\-70%

# AL and BA Cost Structure (per passenger)

Airline Industry is dominated by fixed costs

# Efficiency U.S. VS European Airlines

Number of passengers per staff

# Ryanair's Cost Structure

Can Ryanair do better?

AL and BA figures are based on their current utilisation rates \(60\-70%\)

Ryanair could spread its fixed costs per flight over more passengers

How much should the costs per passenger be reduced?

# How about the Competitors' Response?

* Ryanair seems to be able to pull it off but
  * Will fares remain at this level or drop further?
  * What response can we expect from competitors?
* Competitors have 2 options \(remember game theory again here\)
  * Peace: Accommodation
  * Fight: Retaliation
* Questions are
  * How expensive would it be to accomodate?
  * How expensive would it be to retaliate?

# Competitors' Response

# Cost of Accommodation

# Cost of Retaliation

* Retaliation: AL and BA cut fares to prevent Ryanair from getting any customers
* Assume they reduce fares from 166\.5 to 98
* Impact of reduced fares
  * Prevent Ryanair from getting customers
  * Could attract new fliers from the sea ferries
  * But how many customers?

# Competitors' Response

* Let's summarize
* Why is the cost of accommodation so low?
  * Ryanair is currently relatively small
  * Analysis assumes that Ryanair does not expand beyond its current seat capacity

# Discussion

* What if Ryanair increases capacity and expands?
  * Going after Ryanair's customers by decreasing prices becomes much more attractive
  * Retaliation \(price war\) becomes more likely
* What happens if marginal costs are high?
  * AL and BA are less likely to drop prices to go after Ryanair's customers

# Strategy and Balanced Scorecard

# Strategy and Profitability

* Strategy describes how an organization __creates value__
* Most critical is the understanding of the industry\.
  * Remember last week's Porter's 5 forces for this analysis
* __Strategy__ \, __profitability__ and __performance and control__ are all linked
  * Today\, we focus on how to organize our thoughts
  * In next sessions\, we will talk more about __Control and Performance Evaluation__

* What affects profitability and how to measure it?
* Financial measures
  * Accounting\-based measures \(sales\, profit\, cash\-flow \.\.\.\)
  * Market\-based measure \(stock returns\)
* Limitations of financial measures
  * Impact of risky decisions \(short\-term vs long\-term\)
  * Financial measures are the __outcome__ of decisions\.
  * It is __Historical__ \.

* Non\-Financial measures
  * Productivity
  * Quality
  * Customer Satisfaction
  * Market Share
  * \.\.\.
* Contrary to financial measures\, non\-financial measures are difficult to estimate
* How do we assess their impact for profitability?

# Balanced Score Card

* Provides a __framework__ to understand and __explicit__ the link between strategy and performance measures to improve profitability\.
* Uses multiple Financial and Non\-Financial measures to
  * Clarify
  * Communicate
  * Implement
  * Evaluate business strategy

# Balanced Score Card

* Measures should be linked by __cause\-and\-effect__
* Balanced Scorecard should
  * Articulate __strategy__
  * Communicate strategy via specific __measures__
  * Emphasize measures that are linked to __results and goals__

Learning & growth

# Takeaways

* Joint Product Cost should be though of differently
* Strategic interaction is important in profitability analysis
* Balanced Scorecard provides a framework to think of strategy\, performances\, and appropriate performances/profitability measurements
  * Let's see how this works for Store24after the break
