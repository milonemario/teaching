<h3>Background: Precision Worldwide</h3>
<ul>
<li>Manufacturer of industrial machines and equipment for sale in numerous countries
<ul>
<li>Models priced between $18,900 and $28,900</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Repair and replacement parts accounted for a substantial part of the company’s business</li>
<li>In particular PWI manufactured a <strong>steel ring</strong> that can be found in PWI’s and similar competitor’s machines</li>
<li>Back of the envelope calculations:
<ul>
<li>2-6 rings per machine – normal life of about 2 months</li>
<li>Each ring cost $13.50, meaning revenue of $162-$486 per machine per year</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Company’s success factors
<ul>
<li>Customer relationship / satisfaction</li>
<li>Quality</li>
<li>Market share</li>
<li>Servicing machines …</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Competition is increasing
<ul>
<li>Japanese firms with lower-priced machines</li>
<li>Other companies with lower-quality and lower-priced machines</li>
</ul></li>
<li>French competitor Henri Poulenc just introduced a plastic ring substitute
<ul>
<li>Much longer life than the steel ring (lasts 4 times as long)</li>
<li>Much lower manufacturing cost</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Henri Poulenc is the main competitor in France</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="thorborgs-problem" class="slide level3">
<h3>Thorborg’s Problem</h3>
<p>PWI had a large quantity of steel rings on hand and a substantial inventory of special steel that had been purchase for their manufacture</p>
<p>The special steel could not be sold, even for scrap</p>
<p>The total book value of these inventories exceeded $390,000</p>
</section>
<section id="main-issue-decision" class="slide level3">
<h3>Main issue / decision?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Should we forecast whether the future is steel vs plastic rings?
<ul>
<li>No – The future is plastic: lasts longer and cheaper to produce</li>
<li>Only costs $7,500 to acquire the tools and equipment</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The issue is what to do with the existing inventory and raw material on hand
<ul>
<li>Write off / Scrap?</li>
<li>Keep using?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If we write off the inventory, the income statement is hit immediately
<ul>
<li>Reduction in income/earnings of $390,000</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-alternatives" class="slide level3">
<h3>The alternatives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Stay out of plastic rings altogether</li>
<li>Stay out of plastic rings until all steel rings and all raw steel inventory is sold
<ul>
<li>Manufacture steel rings with excesslabor</li>
<li>Manufacture steel rings with normallabor</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Stay out of plastic rings until all steel rings are sold, but dispose of raw steel inventory</li>
<li>Sell both plastic rings and steel rings until all steel has been converted and sold
<ul>
<li>Sell plastic rings only in France</li>
<li>Sell plastic rings in all markets</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sell plastic rings only, as soon as possible</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="players-and-tensions" class="slide level3">
<h3>Players and tensions</h3>
</section>
<section id="what-should-thorborg-decide" class="slide level3">
<h3>What should Thorborg decide?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Roadmap
<ul>
<li>Relevant Costs</li>
<li>Opportunity Costs</li>
<li>Price relationship</li>
<li>Other considerations</li>
<li>Conclusion</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="what-do-we-know" class="slide level3">
<h3>What do we know?</h3>
<p>Total costs</p>
<p>Variable cost represents 40% of the departmental amounts</p>
</section>
<section id="financial-accounting" class="slide level3">
<h3>Financial Accounting</h3>
<ul>
<li>Assume that we can sell the rings at the same price (what HP is charging for the plastic ring)</li>
<li>Plastic seems to be more profitable (much cheaper to produce)
<ul>
<li>Is there more to it than meets the eyes?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="relevant-costs" class="slide level3">
<h3>Relevant Costs</h3>
<ul>
<li>What should matter to compare the cost of plastic and steel rings?
<ul>
<li>Variable costs and contribution margin of course!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Assume (still) that we can sell the rings at the same price</p>
<p>Steel looks much more profitable now</p>
</section>
<section id="financial-vs-managerial-accounting" class="slide level3">
<h3>Financial VS Managerial accounting</h3>
<ul>
<li>If we rely on full costs (included in COGS), plastic seems more profitable</li>
<li>But looking more closely at the data, the story changes</li>
<li>The story depends on the assumptions!
<ul>
<li>Sales price stays the same</li>
<li>Arguments for and against?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="is-that-all" class="slide level3">
<h3>Is that all?</h3>
<ul>
<li>So far, we only looked at plastic vs steel rings</li>
<li>But the decision faced byThorborginvolves more than that
<ul>
<li>What should we do about the existing inventory?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="relevant-costs-for-inventories" class="slide level3">
<h3>Relevant Costs for inventories</h3>
<ul>
<li>For existing steel rings
<ul>
<li>No extra cost, pure profit</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How about converting the steel?</li>
<li>We know that during the next 2-3 months the plant would not operate at capacity (the time to prepare production for the plastic ring, from May to September)
<ul>
<li>PWI policy is to still pay workers 70% of their salary instead of laying off</li>
<li>We could decide to have them produce steel ring instead</li>
<li>What is the <strong>opportunity cost</strong> of not producing more steel rings?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Only need to pay workers an additional 30% for the next 3 months</p>
<p>Remember: Financial Accounting costs of $1,108</p>
</section>
<section id="price-relationships" class="slide level3">
<h3>Price relationships</h3>
<ul>
<li>Assumptions are important!</li>
<li>We assumed that
<ul>
<li>Price would stay the same</li>
<li>Demand would not change</li>
<li>No impact on customer satisfaction</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We cannot predict future prices with the given data</li>
<li>But we can compute what the prices should be to produce identical contribution margins.
<ul>
<li>What price should the steel ring be sold at to have the same CM as the plastic ring?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Assume plastic ring sells for $1,350</p>
<p>Remember: Contribution margin of the plastic ring is $1,214</p>
<p>To have the same CM, steel ring must generate $1,214 / 4 = $304 in CM</p>
<ul>
<li>Again, we assume that the price of plastic ring being charged by HP stays the same</li>
<li>Assume you are a customer and know that the plastic ring has 4x the durability of the steel ring?
<ul>
<li>How much would you be willing to pay for the steel ring? Probably $1,350 / 4 = $338</li>
<li>If this happens, it would only be profitable to sell the existing stock of rings, but not produce any additional ones using the steel.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Is that likely to happen?</li>
<li>What are the assumptions necessary for such a price drop to occur?</li>
<li>What if we believe customers would not know about the extra durability?</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="other-considerations" class="slide level3">
<h3>Other considerations</h3>
<p>Would customers be angry if PWI sells plastic rings to some and steel rings to others?</p>
<p>What are the reputation consequences of not moving to plastic quickly enough?</p>
<p>Should we be concerned of plastic rings quality issues?</p>
<p>What about the competition? (HP may want to expand outside France)</p>
<p>How will that decision affect the sales of other PWI products (mainly machines)?</p>

<h3>What should Hans Thorborg decide?</h3>
</section>
<section id="a-possible-solution-one-amongst-many" class="slide level3">
<h3>A possible solution – One amongst many</h3>
<ul>
<li>Convert the steel inventory into rings during the summer
<ul>
<li>Use the excesslaborat an incremental cost of 30% to do so</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Introduce plastic rings throughout the entire market in September</li>
<li>Set the price of the plastic rings to match or slightly undercut HP</li>
<li>Announce the more desirable properties of the plastic rings</li>
<li>Start a pricing policy for the steel rings
<ul>
<li>Maybe start to reduce price by about 30%</li>
<li>Drop the price further as market dictates</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="takeaways" class="slide level3">
<h3>Takeaways</h3>
<ul>
<li>The same product can have different costs depending on
<ul>
<li>Decision-making context</li>
<li>Time horizon</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Relevant Costs = Expected Costs that differ among alternatives
<ul>
<li>Sunk Costs are often irrelevant for decision-making</li>
</ul></li>
<li>As a decision maker, it is your job to appreciate these tensions</li>
</ul>
