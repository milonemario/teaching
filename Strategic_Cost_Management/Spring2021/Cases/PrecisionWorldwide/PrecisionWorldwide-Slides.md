### Background: Precision Worldwide

* Manufacturer of industrial machines and equipment for sale in numerous countries
  * Models priced between $18\,900 and $28\,900
* Repair and replacement parts accounted for a substantial part of the company’s business
* In particular PWI manufactured a __steel ring__ that can be found in PWI’s and similar competitor’s machines
* Back of the envelope calculations:
  * 2\-6 rings per machine – normal life of about 2 months
  * Each ring cost $13\.50\, meaning revenue of $162\-$486 per machine per year

* Company’s success factors
  * Customer relationship / satisfaction
  * Quality
  * Market share
  * Servicing machines …

* Competition is increasing
  * Japanese firms with lower\-priced machines
  * Other companies with lower\-quality and lower\-priced machines

* French competitor Henri Poulenc just introduced a plastic ring substitute
  * Much longer life than the steel ring \(lasts 4 times as long\)
  * Much lower manufacturing cost
* Henri Poulenc is the main competitor in France

### Thorborg’s Problem

PWI had a large quantity of steel rings on hand and a substantial inventory of special steel that had been purchase for their manufacture

The special steel could not be sold\, even for scrap

The total book value of these inventories exceeded $390\,000

### Main issue / decision?

* Should we forecast whether the future is steel vs plastic rings?
  * No – The future is plastic: lasts longer and cheaper to produce
  * Only costs $7\,500 to acquire the tools and equipment
* The issue is what to do with the existing inventory and raw material on hand
  * Write off / Scrap?
  * Keep using?
* If we write off the inventory\, the income statement is hit immediately
  * Reduction in income/earnings of $390\,000

### The alternatives

* Stay out of plastic rings altogether
* Stay out of plastic rings until all steel rings and all raw steel inventory is sold
  * Manufacture steel rings with excesslabor
  * Manufacture steel rings with normallabor
* Stay out of plastic rings until all steel rings are sold\, but dispose of raw steel inventory
* Sell both plastic rings and steel rings until all steel has been converted and sold
  * Sell plastic rings only in France
  * Sell plastic rings in all markets
* Sell plastic rings only\, as soon as possible

### Players and tensions

### What should Thorborg decide?

* Roadmap
  * Relevant Costs
  * Opportunity Costs
  * Price relationship
  * Other considerations
  * Conclusion

### What do we know?

Total costs

Variable cost represents 40% of the departmental amounts

### Financial Accounting

* Assume that we can sell the rings at the same price \(what HP is charging for the plastic ring\)
* Plastic seems to be more profitable \(much cheaper to produce\)
  * Is there more to it than meets the eyes?

### Relevant Costs

* What should matter to compare the cost of plastic and steel rings?
  * Variable costs and contribution margin of course\!

Assume \(still\) that we can sell the rings at the same price

Steel looks much more profitable now

### Financial VS Managerial accounting

* If we rely on full costs \(included in COGS\)\, plastic seems more profitable
* But looking more closely at the data\, the story changes
* The story depends on the assumptions\!
  * Sales price stays the same
  * Arguments for and against?

### Is that all?

* So far\, we only looked at plastic vs steel rings
* But the decision faced byThorborginvolves more than that
  * What should we do about the existing inventory?

### Relevant Costs for inventories

* For existing steel rings
  * No extra cost\, pure profit
* How about converting the steel?
* We know that during the next 2\-3 months the plant would not operate at capacity \(the time to prepare production for the plastic ring\, from May to September\)
  * PWI policy is to still pay workers 70% of their salary instead of laying off
  * We could decide to have them produce steel ring instead
  * What is the __opportunity cost__ of not producing more steel rings?

Only need to pay workers an additional 30% for the next 3 months

Remember: Financial Accounting costs of $1\,108

### Price relationships

* Assumptions are important\!
* We assumed that
  * Price would stay the same
  * Demand would not change
  * No impact on customer satisfaction
* We cannot predict future prices with the given data
* But we can compute what the prices should be to produce identical contribution margins\.
  * What price should the steel ring be sold at to have the same CM as the plastic ring?

Assume plastic ring sells for $1\,350

Remember: Contribution margin of the plastic ring is $1\,214

To have the same CM\, steel ring must generate $1\,214 / 4 = $304 in CM

* Again\, we assume that the price of plastic ring being charged by HP stays the same
* Assume you are a customer and know that the plastic ring has 4x the durability of the steel ring?
  * How much would you be willing to pay for the steel ring? Probably $1\,350 / 4 = $338
  * If this happens\, it would only be profitable to sell the existing stock of rings\, but not produce any additional ones using the steel\.
* Is that likely to happen?
* What are the assumptions necessary for such a price drop to occur?
* What if we believe customers would not know about the extra durability?

### Other considerations

Would customers be angry if PWI sells plastic rings to some and steel rings to others?

What are the reputation consequences of not moving to plastic quickly enough?

Should we be concerned of plastic rings quality issues?

What about the competition? \(HP may want to expand outside France\)

How will that decision affect the sales of other PWI products \(mainly machines\)?

### What should Hans Thorborg decide?

### A possible solution – One amongst many

* Convert the steel inventory into rings during the summer
  * Use the excesslaborat an incremental cost of 30% to do so
* Introduce plastic rings throughout the entire market in September
* Set the price of the plastic rings to match or slightly undercut HP
* Announce the more desirable properties of the plastic rings
* Start a pricing policy for the steel rings
  * Maybe start to reduce price by about 30%
  * Drop the price further as market dictates

### Takeaways

* The same product can have different costs depending on
  * Decision\-making context
  * Time horizon
* Relevant Costs = Expected Costs that differ among alternatives
  * Sunk Costs are often irrelevant for decision\-making
* As a decision maker\, it is your job to appreciate these tensions
